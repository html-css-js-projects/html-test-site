    How can I develop a great software that customers would love? That's the question I ask myself every single time when I have to do Ð° project, whether it's for university or for work. In each case it has come down to creativity and experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the moment, I'm a senior student at Technical University of Varna, studying Software and Internet technologies. In those 4 years of education, I went through many programming languages such as C/C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, but my personal favorites are JavaScript and Java. That's why I want to become a web developer, slowly building my way up to a full-stack. But as a beginner, I'm looking forward to start with front-end development.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a developer I'm trying my best to create things that are unique. I use algorithms, design patterns and engineering principles to craft and mold products that the customers would love. At the same time I'm efficient and perfectionist - everything I do has to be perfect. I have to be creative to put all these pieces together.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm unemployed but I'm looking for interships and a starting job as a junior software developer to get the necessary knowledge and work experience in the field of information technologies and software development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm a life long learner. I would like to become a web developer and maybe in the future, I would like to teach people some JavaScript or Java. I'm a quick learner and I'm trying to work as fast as I can. I'm also a self-learner - sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to do some simple projects to maintain and eventually improve my skills.
